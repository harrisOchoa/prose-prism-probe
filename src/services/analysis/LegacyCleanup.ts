 * Legacy Analysis System Cleanup
 * 
 * This file documents the legacy files that have been replaced by the unified system
 * and should be removed in the next cleanup phase.
 * 
 * LEGACY FILES TO REMOVE:
 * - src/services/geminiEnhanced.ts (replaced by AIServiceManager)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysisService.ts (replaced by UnifiedAnalysisService)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/initiateAnalysisEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/evaluateWritingEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/generateBasicInsightsEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/generateAdvancedAnalysisEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * 
 * HOOKS TO UPDATE:
 * - Replace useAssessmentView imports with useOptimizedAssessmentView
 * - Update any remaining references to legacy analysis functions
 * 
 * MIGRATION COMPLETE:
 * âœ… Created UnifiedAnalysisService with caching, batching, and deduplication
 * âœ… Added performance monitoring throughout the analysis pipeline
 * âœ… Implemented immutable update patterns
 * âœ… Added optimized Firebase batch updates
 * âœ… Created request deduplication to prevent redundant API calls
 * âœ… Unified all analysis functionality into a single, optimized service
