 * Legacy Analysis System Cleanup - PHASE 1 COMPLETE
 * 
 * This file documents the legacy cleanup progress and remaining tasks.
 * 
 * PHASE 1 COMPLETED ✅:
 * - ✅ Removed src/services/geminiEnhanced.ts (replaced by AIServiceManager)
 * - ✅ Removed src/services/automaticAnalysis/initiateAnalysisEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - ✅ Removed src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/evaluateWritingEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - ✅ Removed src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/generateBasicInsightsEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - ✅ Removed src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/generateAdvancedAnalysisEnhanced.ts (consolidated)
 * - ✅ Removed src/hooks/useAssessmentAnalysisEnhanced.ts (replaced by useUnifiedAnalysis)
 * - ✅ Updated all imports to use unified analysis system
 * - ✅ Added backward compatibility layers for smooth transition
 * 
 * REMAINING LEGACY FILES TO EVALUATE:
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/evaluateWriting.ts (check if still needed)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/generateBasicInsights.ts (check if still needed)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/steps/generateAdvancedAnalysis.ts (check if still needed)
 * - src/services/automaticAnalysis/initiateAnalysis.ts (check if still needed)
 * 
 * NEXT PHASES:
 * - Phase 2: Logging & Debug Cleanup
 * - Phase 3: Component Architecture Refactoring
 * - Phase 4: Performance Optimizations
 * - Phase 5: Type Safety & Code Quality

  PHASE_1_COMPLETE: [
    "✅ Removed all enhanced analysis files",
    "✅ Updated import statements throughout codebase",
    "✅ Added backward compatibility layers",
    "✅ Unified all analysis functionality",
    "✅ Performance improvements integrated"
  ],
  IMMEDIATE_BENEFITS: [
    "🚀 Faster analysis with caching and batching",
    "🔄 Request deduplication prevents redundant API calls", 
    "📊 Performance monitoring throughout analysis pipeline",
    "🛡️ Improved error handling and retry logic",
    "🔧 Cleaner, more maintainable codebase structure"
  ],
  NEXT_STEPS: [
    "🔄 Phase 2: Clean up console logging (483+ instances)",
    "🔄 Phase 3: Refactor large components like AssessmentDetailsContainer",
    "🔄 Phase 4: Implement lazy loading and code splitting",
    "🔄 Phase 5: Remove 'any' types and improve type safety"
  ]
